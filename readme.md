## Repository Contents

### Notebooks

- `1_brain-tumor-segmentation.ipynb`  
  Implementation of brain tumor segmentation using classical image processing techniques and evaluation metrics.

- `2_white_blood_cell_segmentation.ipynb`  
  Segmentation of white blood cell nuclei using clustering techniques such as K-Means and Fuzzy C-Means, with comparison of segmentation quality.

- `3_retinal_vessel_extraction.ipynb`  
  Extraction of thin retinal blood vessels from fundus images using adaptive thresholding methods such as Niblack and Sauvola.

- `4_cell_nuclei_seperation.ipynb`  
  Separation of touching and overlapping cell nuclei using marker-controlled watershed segmentation and comparison with non-marker watershed.
